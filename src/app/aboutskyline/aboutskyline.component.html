				<h3>Shawn Kennedy</h3>
				<p>
					As a teacher that enables students to get real-world experience making products like t-shirts, stickers, and other physical realizations of digital design, Kennedy has done a great deal for the CTE program. He brought with him to Skyline all his years of experience as an entrepreneur and a worker in the industry and has imparted much of that knowledge into his students. In addition to the knowledge, Kennedy has given CTE students a taste of the work ethic necessary for the jobs his classes give experience, letting students get a real taste in the industry.</p>
