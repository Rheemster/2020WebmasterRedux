        <h2 class="text">Electric Cars</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Over the past few years, because of stunning technological advancements and innovations, a viable alternative to the traditional automobile has finally materialized: the electric vehicle. Electric vehicles use Lithium-Ion batteries as their power sources, which allow them to run purely off of electricity provided by charging stations. In addition to their countless environmental benefits, modern electric cars are also more responsive, higher torque, and easier to maintain than many of their traditional counterparts.
